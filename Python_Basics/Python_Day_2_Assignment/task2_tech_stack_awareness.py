## Task 2: Tech Stack Awareness 
# Create two Python lists: 
# ● Front-end technologies 
# ● Back-end technologies 
# Print both lists with meaningful labels. 
# Example ideas (you may add your own): 
# ● Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
# ● Back-end: Python, Django, Node.js

# Single-line comment: This program defines and prints lists of front-end and back-end technologies.

Front_end_technologies = ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript", "React", "Vue.js"]
Back_end_technologies = ["Python", "Django", "Node.js", "Express", "Java"]

print("Front-end Technologies:", Front_end_technologies)
print("Back-end Technologies:", Back_end_technologies)
