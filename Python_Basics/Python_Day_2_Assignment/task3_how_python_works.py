## Task 3: How Python Works 
# Using print() statements, explain in your own words: 
# ● What is a Python interpreter? 
# ● How Python code gets executed step by step

code_execution_steps = """ step 1: We write our Python code in a text editor or an IDE.,
    step 2: When we run the code, the Python interpreter reads our code from starting to end and checks for any errors like syntax, variable, value errors,etc.,
    step 3: It translates each line of code into language that the computer can understand like when we speak to a person who is unable to understand us in hindi we have to communicate in English.,
    step 4: The interpreter executes the translated instructions one by one, performing the tasks we specified in our code.,
    step 5: Finally, the interpreter provides the output or results of our code execution on the screen or saves it to a file, depending on what we asked it to do."""
